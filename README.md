# Project finished 24/05/2020
Project done during my last year of engineering school.
Building an infrastructure for a connected mall, including :
  - Hadoop architecrure [HDFS/Spark], you may find architectur's diagrams in the folder 'architecture'.
  - PowerBI Server in order to work on and upload dashboards for business users - the dashboards are too heavy to be upload on gitHub.
  - Machine Learning sales forecasting, you may find the notebook in the folder 'sales forecasting'.
I also added some comments on how to improve the models for the Machine Learning model.

This project was a continuity of a long term project for the 3 years of graduation - as a French grand ecole, engineering is dispensed throughout 3 years, you may also find in "pds ing1" the walking skeleton of the project done during the first year.
